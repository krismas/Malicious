Usage
---
### via HTTP

```
http://mydomain.com/Malicious/index.php?s=mysecretkey
```

### via CLI

```
php index.php -s=mysecretkey
```

Plugins
---

Active plugins are defined in config.php` via `MCS_PLUGINS` (Check) and `MCS_REPORTS` (Report) constants:

```
define('MCS_PLUGINS'  , 'readable,big');
define('MCS_REPORTS'  , 'echo');
```

You can declare more than one configuration :

```
define('MCS_PLUGINS_1'  , 'readable,exec,eval');
define('MCS_REPORTS_1'  , 'echo,log');
```

And use this new configuration with `c` and `r` parameters :

```
http://mydomain.com/Malicious/index.php?s=mysecretkey&c=1&r=1
```
